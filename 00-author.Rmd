### Juniper's Positionality Statement {-}

I am white, middle-class, "millenial", transgender/non-binary/genderqueer/agender female, physically (fibromatosis) and psychologically (complex-PTSD) disabled, single, without dependents, non-veteran, raised-Catholic, atheist, housed, of European ancestry, and from the midwestern United States of America but living in the Pacific Northwest. 
I have lived on, currently live on, or conducted research on the traditional, unceded [lands of many indigenous nations](https://native-land.ca/), including the Potowatami, Kickapoo, Sioux, Oklahoma, Peoria, Miami, Creek, Haudenosaunee, Cayuga, Susquehannock, Kumeyaay, Pennacook, Wabanaki, Kō Hawaiʻi Paeʻāina, Clackamas, and Cowlitz peoples.
My ability to exist, thrive, and conduct research is predicated on a colonialist, capitalist, imperialist cultural system that was built by my ancestors and which I perpetuate, but seek to dimantle.
