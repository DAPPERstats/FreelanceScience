["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 “A freelance what?”", " Chapter 1 Introduction In this book, you’ll find insights and lessons learned from my experiences as a freelance (data) scientist and entrepreneur as well as tips and tricks for getting started on your own freelance science journey. This book is an early work in progress, and as such, the content and structure are evolving. Presently, the content is organized by overarching aspects of freelancing science being broken down into specific tasks, with an introduction to the overarching concept here. 1.1 “A freelance what?” In the most direct sense, freelancing means that you’re your own boss and you get work from multiple sources. A freelance scientist is then just someone who does science for multiple entities but is functionall self-employed. For me, I have set up DAPPER Stats as a legal entity so I can get contracts for reasearch, teaching, and training that bring in money to cover my salary, benefits, and other work costs (equipment, travel, training, etc.) while being independent from the organizations I collaborate with. As a freelancer, you might get work through an agency, company, or union that represents you, or you could create your own business entity that allows you to obtain work directly from clients. With the goal of empowering you to #BuildYourOwn, this book will discuss working through entities, but focuses primarily on setting up your own entity. Similar to other freelancing careers, there are many ways to become a successful Freelance Scientist: you can stay a solo operation or grow to include employees, for example. And which career path makes sense will vary based on the scientist and their life situation, and could easily change over time. The goal of this book is therefore to show the benefits, considerations, and negatives of a variety of trajectories and decisions, rather than elevate a single path as the optimal choice. "],

In general (non-academic) spaces, this is often referred to as business development, which more generally refers to the processes used to create a capital-based organization. 3.1 Leveraging Existing Projects As scientists, we develop personal and intimate knowledge of the research projects we work on. In the context of establishing new lines of funding for your organization, it is important to acknoweledge when your specialization is to a point that it is not efficient (from a business perspective) for your former employer to hire and train up new staff. When you are in such a position, you hold important power within the project, which can be useful in retaining your position within the project even if your employment position changes. This specialized training-based power affords you negotiating leverage that, when used appropriately, supports continuation and possibly expansion of the project. However, this leverage can easily be misued and has the potential to result in your connection to the project being severed; after all, someone else can be trained up on it. All that is to say leveraging existing projects can be a key contributor to establishing your freelance self, but must be done in an appropriate, collaborative fashion. 3.1.1 From Employee to Subcontractor 3.2 Listservs 3.3 Cold Calls/Cold E-mails 3.4 Meetings 3.4.1 Local Conferences 3.4.2 (Inter)National Conferences "],
