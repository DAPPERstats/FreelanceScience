["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction In this book, you’ll find insights and lessons learned from my experiences as a freelance data scientist and entrepreneur. By no means do I intend this book to be some definitive guide to freelancing science, but rather a compilation of what has (and has not) worked for me in setting up DAPPER stats. There are as many possible paths to freelancing as there are potential freelancers, and indeed, that’s why the title is A –not The– Freelance Science Experiment. This book is a (very early) work in progress, and as such, the content and structure are evolving. Presently, the content is organized by overarching aspects of freelancing science being broken down into specific tasks. "],
