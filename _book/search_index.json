["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 “A freelance what?”", " Chapter 1 Introduction In this book, you’ll find insights and lessons learned from my experiences as a freelance (data) scientist and entrepreneur as well as tips and tricks for getting started on your own freelance science journey. This book is an early work in progress, and as such, the content and structure are evolving. Presently, the content is organized by overarching aspects of freelancing science being broken down into specific tasks, with an introduction to the overarching concept here. 1.1 “A freelance what?” In the most direct sense, freelancing means that you’re your own boss and you get work from multiple sources. A freelance scientist is then just someone who does science for multiple entities but is functionall self-employed. For me, I have set up DAPPER Stats as a legal entity so I can get contracts for reasearch, teaching, and training that bring in money to cover my salary, benefits, and other work costs (equipment, travel, training, etc.) while being independent from the organizations I collaborate with. As a freelancer, you might get work through an agency, company, or union that represents you, or you could create your own business entity that allows you to obtain work directly from clients. With the goal of empowering you to #BuildYourOwn, this book will discuss working through entities, but focuses primarily on setting up your own entity. Similar to other freelancing careers, there are many ways to become a successful Freelance Scientist: you can stay a solo operation or grow to include employees, for example. And which career path makes sense will vary based on the scientist and their life situation, and could easily change over time. The goal of this book is therefore to show the benefits, considerations, and negatives of a variety of trajectories and decisions, rather than elevate a single path as the optimal choice. "],
